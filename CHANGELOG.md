# Changelog

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
OptArena hasn't cut a versioned release yet (pre-PyPI-publish, still
`0.1.0`), so this starts from the current `v0.1` branch state rather than
reconstructing full project history - see `git log` for everything before
this file existed.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Dropped all VS Code/IDE UI-automation drivers (Cline, Roo Code, Continue,
  Kilo Code) and the `ui-harness/`/`legacy/` support code. IDE automation
  drove an evolving third-party UI (selector drift, onboarding-wizard
  churn) - a maintenance surface disproportionate to the value it added.
  The project now focuses on CLI, raw API, and in-process SDK/agent-framework
  drivers only. (Still available on `main` for anyone who needs it.)

### Added

- Five new in-process SDK/agent-framework drivers: OpenAI Agents SDK,
  smolagents, LangGraph, AutoGen, and Semantic Kernel (alongside the
  existing crewAI driver) - each its own `pip install optarena[<extra>]`.
- `--num-ctx` flag / `backend.num_ctx` scenario field for overriding
  Ollama's context length on the `ollama-chat` driver.

### Fixed

- `subprocess_env()`'s allowlist now matches environment-variable names
  case-insensitively and includes `SystemDrive` - both were silently
  dropping Windows env vars some Node-based tools need, causing hard
  crashes or workspace pollution rather than a clean error.
- `openai-agents`, `crewai`, and `langgraph` SDK drivers no longer send
  prompts/telemetry to their frameworks' own hosted tracing endpoints by
  default - a real, quiet leak against the "local-first" design.
- `opencode` driver no longer leaves a temp file with the backend's API key
  behind after every run.
